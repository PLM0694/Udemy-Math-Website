# Udemy-Math-Website
This project came from this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-web-development-course/

The purpose of this exercise is to become familar with HTML and CSS coding. The colors are not exactly the same as the course and was changed based on
personal preference. 

Update 1: Added flex properties to objects.
